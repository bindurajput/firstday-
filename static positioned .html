<h2>Static Postioned properties;</h2>

<p>HTML elements are positioned static by default.
Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.
An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is 
always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>

<div class="static">
HTML elements are positioned static by default;
</div>

</body>
